I wish I could provide a compelling or fascinating story that leads to my decision to begin learning software development.  Of course, there are all the obvious reasons to pursue software development as a career.  It's an "in demand" skill set that has and continues to change the world around us.  It also seems clear that software will only become more ubiquitous in our lives in the future with more and more items having some kind of software built into them.  However, the fact is none of that is my primary motivation.   I'm probably a little older than the average software development student.  As a result, I've had the opportunity to work in multiple fields and in a variety of positions so far in my life.  While some of my work experiences have been interesting and rewarding I have often found myself feeling capable and desiring more of a challenge. 

That internal feeling for more challenge and creativity ultimately led me to software development.  I've often been an early adopter of equipment and technology.  I enjoy learning about and experimenting with new stuff while trying to figure out how it works.  I learn best by breaking something and putting it back together.  As I researched and learned more about software development prior to beginning this program at Flatiron School it became clear to me that my desire to figure out how things work could likely be applied to software too.  

So, I started researching and talking to people I knew who have experience in the field of software development and technology.  There was one consistent theme I walked away with; the ability and desire to continue learning is a key attribute to software development.  Most people I spoke with have learned multiple program languages in their lives and they expect to have to learn more in the future.  This dynamic and fluid state of change is exciting to me.  

I don't expect my journey to be easy.  I know I will get stuck, confused, and maybe even feel frustrated at times.  But the need to continue to learn how stuff works will suit me in the long run I believe.  My hope is that to be continuously challenged will lead to greater satisfaction and contentment.  I'm old enough to understand the value in that goal.
