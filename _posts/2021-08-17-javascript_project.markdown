At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I clearly learn best by doing.  I won't lie, the switch from Rails to Javascript was a difficult one for me, for various reasons.  I seemed to find myself constantly mixing up my Ruby code into my Javascript code as I was going along the Javascript module.  In addition, I found it surprising that the relative flexibility of Javascript compared to Ruby and Rails actually made it more difficult to grasp Javascript.  I also needed time and practice to better understand the different layers of Javascript.  I don't have it all nailed down but I feel a lot better after this project.  The reason I bring that up is because working on the Javascript Project eventually allowed me to get over some of that, though it took some time.  

In an attempt to continue making projects that speak to me, I chose to do build a project that I could see myself and my neighbors using.  The idea is be able to create a digital neighborhood and within that neighborhood be able to create a directory of dogs (and other pets eventually), in an effort to make it easier to know the various pets living in your neighborhood.  This could have benefits for pet owners and non pet owners alike.  In fact I could envision non pet owners using an application like this to possibly calm potential fears if there were a loose dog running around the neighborhood they didn't know.  If they could go onto a directory and find that dog and read whether it was friendly or not, might make someone who is apprehensive about dogs a little less fearful.  Knowledge is power after all.  

To start, I found this project to be a nice refresher of the Rails database.  After completing the Rails project previously, creating this Rails API felt quite comfortable.  It was fun to see the database created viewable in a browser window, knowing that we could use Fetch to grab that data and update the DOM however we wanted.  Knowing that and executing that were two different things, of course.  But to see the potential of what one could do was what I initially got excited about.  

Once I got my first read Fetch completed and the DOM manipulated with the data retrieved I started to feel a lot more confidence.  Just that little bit of experience boosted my desire to do more with the data.  Creating the Post Fetch function wasn't quite as smooth but once completed I felt more knowledgeable in Fetch and the data I was getting back in JSON.  

The other piece of this puzzle that started to come together in my mind as I worked on this project was the idea of creating a skeleton of the frontend with Divs and the ability to manipulate the DOM in ways that I envisioned in my head.  A small but effective piece of this puzzle was understanding how and when to hide and show different Divs and elements on the DOM that I was working with to create the user experience I had in mind.  

I obviously have a long way to go and lot to learn about Javascript.  While the transition from Rails to Javascript was a bit of a difficult one for me, ultimately working on this project allowed me to take what we had learned and mess around with it, mold it, break it, and eventually turn out something similar to what I had set out to in my mind.  

I look forward to learning a lot more about Javascript and the ability to turn the DOM into whatever one has in mind.
