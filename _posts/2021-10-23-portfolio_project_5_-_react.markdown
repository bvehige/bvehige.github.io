React and Redux are clearly powerful tools for manipulating the DOM and creating a dynamic application and user experience.  In this module I feel like I have learned quite a bit about using components, state, props, and a store to develop a powerful and scalable application.  While at the same time, it's clear that I have so much more to learn, experiment with, and explore using React and Redux.  In fact, that's been a common feeling at the end of all the modules; I have so much more to learn.  That's an exciting thought.  

I have to admit that I struggled with the transitions from module to module in this curriculum.  Just as I felt like I was getting my bearings and teeth into the meat of the subject at hand it was time to shift and learn something different.  The React module was no different for me.  It took me some time to make the mental shift into using components as the primary way to manipulate a virtual DOM.  One has to think about designing and structuring an application differently when using components as the building blocks.  But as I began to find my way in React I started to realize what a great tool it is develop a powerful and scalable application rather quickly.

Initially I found React to be abstract and that took practice to get comfortable with.  I really appreciated the “code alongs” in this module, which I used to slowly walk through and gain a better understanding of what's possible.  Learning React forced me to worry less about what's happening "under the hood", if you will, and concentrate more on how to utilize what it has to offer.  This became most obvious to me when Redux was introduced.  The idea of creating a store and using it to house state and actions that can be connected and dispatched to different components is wonderful for developing a scalable application, but it took patience and practice to get my head around.  I can see how using Redux could seem like overkill in the early stages of development but doing so truly seems to make managing the application a lot easier as it grows in size and complexity.  

Similar to the other modules, working on a project to finish the module helped me put it all together.  Having the chance to build an application from scratch, experiment with it, break it, fix it, etc..., is what I need to begin to fully grasp the potential with a framework like React.  No doubt, I have just scratched the surface, I need and welcome more time to develop and practice with this dynamic, powerful, and fun framework.  But I'm excited to have enough knowledge to be able to do just that.
