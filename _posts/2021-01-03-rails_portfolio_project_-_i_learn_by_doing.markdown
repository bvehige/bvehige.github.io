Once again, it's clear to me that I'm a hands on learner.  The rails project just reinforced what I probably already knew.  Reading the curriculum and the rails guides and completing the labs are all good tools for learning, but actually getting into a project gives me the opportunity to truly absorb, learn and build some confidence in the subjects we have covered.  

It took me a lot of time to decide on an idea to pursue for my rails project.  I did lots of rough sketching out of ideas, the old fashioned way, with pencil and paper.  From models relationships, routes, and views, I drew, designed, and charted all kinds of different project ideas in an attempt to find something I liked, could manage as a first rails project, and of course that would meet the project requirements.

Ultimately, I fell back on something related to what I have enjoyed for a significant part of my life, tennis.  My tennis friends and I regularly discuss and debate the various tennis rackets we use and have tried over the years.  It’s fun to compare notes on all the new equipment, but also older rackets that have stood the test of time. We all play a slightly different style of tennis and each racket plays a little different, depending upon the type of player you are.  

With that idea in mind I moved ahead with a project I called “Racket Talk”.  The idea is a racket review site where users could share their opinions and experiences with various rackets.  The idea could ultimately include all kinds of racket equipment from shoes, tennis strings, grips, and other categories of racket sports.  But for the sake of my project I kept the scope of the project centered on tennis rackets.  

Rails is clearly a great resource for getting a project idea off the ground.  Once I had decided on my idea and the model relationships, I found it fairly straight forward to get things up and running in a limited capacity.  Using the Resource generator was extremely helpful for me to get Models, Routes, Controllers and Migrations created.  After that, the real work began for me.

I ended up working a lot in the Rails console to make sure my model relationships were all working like I expected.  Doing so allowed me to solidify my thoughts on how to create the scope and helper methods I would ultimately work on later in the project.  Getting into the mud with the scope methods in this project helped me more clearly understand what they seem to be best suited for and to, specific and custom data queries.  Using the Rails console to help develop and explore scope methods was a valuable lesson for me.  I didn’t use all the different scope methods I ended up exploring in Rails console, but it was a great learning tool.  

Dealing with nested forms and resources was another subject matter that this project helped me more solidify my understanding.  I really dove into the rails guides reading material when working with the nested forms and routes on this project.  Between that reading and having the opportunity to create nested forms, break them, and fix them again helped me better understand a topic that I was slightly fuzzy on, even after the labs.  

I had a similar experience with nested resources.  But again, after more in depth reading and with the chance to experiment in this project I came to truly understand the power of nested resources to maintain a RESTful application despite some more complex model and database relationships.  It seems to me, if one can understand the relationships in a nested resource it makes creating and maintaining a moderately complex app or website a lot more straightforward and less prone to issues.

I took the opportunity to take some time and learn about Active Storage for this project.  I ended up adding the ability for users to upload photos of the rackets they were reviewing.  I can see how Active Storage could be a great tool to use for all kinds of applications.  

All in all, just being able to jump in to create, mess up, fix and explore my first rails project proved extremely valuable to my high level understanding of the curriculum we covered in the Rails module.  It also showed me that I have a ton more to learn, of course.  But I feel more confident in my ability to go out and find what I need to learn when I run into a bug, issue, or idea I want to try and implement.
